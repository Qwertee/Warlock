# Warlock

This is a small demo of sorts that I wrote because I was interested in the way that games were designed. Currently generates a world
with random terrain using the diamond - square algorithm to make a heightmap that is used internally to model the it.

Other then walking around a randomly generated world, there isnt much to do. More work is planned.

### Compiling and Running

This was built with and uses CMake. So depending on your system, different steps may be required to compile this.
Ideally you should make a directory in the project root called 'build' or something, cd into it, and run `cmake ..` 
to get a makefile for the project.
