# Warlock

This is a small demo of sorts that I wrote because I was interested in the way that games were designed.

Far from complete, there isn't much to do right now besides walk around but rest assured - more work is planned.

### Compiling and Running

This was built with and uses CMake. So depending on your system, different steps may be required to compile this.
Ideally you should just be able to call the cmake command in the project root and get a makefile which can be used to
compile and build the project.
